// loops central peice to programming is the ability to look through the same code over and over again
// it reduces repeating code and iterating through the data

// "for" loops require you to set a base number and increment through it under the expression is false

// so we defined the variable x on line by doing let x;
// the for loop will look at x and list out every number that is less that 10 and the x++ will increment that by 1
// so if we run our code it will take x and 0 and then list every number under 10 and it should show up at 0-9

// let x;
// for (x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
//     console.log(x)
// }

// while loops are followed by an expression, while the expression is true, the code will continue to loop through the code

let x = 0;
while (x < 10) {
    console.log(x);
    x++;
}
